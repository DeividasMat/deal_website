# GitHub Actions - Automatic Daily News Fetching

This is a **reliable alternative to Vercel cron jobs** that actually works!

## ‚úÖ What This Does

GitHub Actions will automatically trigger your news fetch **3 times per day**:
- **8:00 AM UTC** (3:00 AM EST)
- **12:00 PM UTC** (7:00 AM EST)  
- **5:00 PM UTC** (12:00 PM EST)

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

The workflow file is already created at `.github/workflows/daily-news-fetch.yml`

Just push it to GitHub:
```bash
git add .github/workflows/daily-news-fetch.yml
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions for automatic daily news fetching"
git push
```

### Step 2: Add Vercel URL Secret (IMPORTANT)

**You need to set your correct Vercel production URL:**

1. **Find your Vercel URL:**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Click on your project
   - Copy your production URL (e.g., `https://deal-website.vercel.app`)
   - Make sure it's the **production** URL, not preview

2. **Add it as a GitHub Secret:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/DeividasMat/deal_website
   - Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
   - Click **New repository secret**
   - Add:
     - **Name:** `VERCEL_URL`
     - **Value:** Your production URL (e.g., `https://deal-website.vercel.app`)
     - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Don't include trailing slash

3. **Alternative - Update Workflow File Directly:**
   - Edit `.github/workflows/daily-news-fetch.yml`
   - Replace the default URL with your actual Vercel URL
   - Line 28: `VERCEL_URL="https://YOUR-ACTUAL-URL.vercel.app"`

### Step 3: Verify It's Working

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click the **Actions** tab
3. You'll see "Daily News Fetch" workflow
4. Wait for scheduled run OR click "Run workflow" to test manually

### Step 4: Test Manually (Optional)

You can trigger it manually to test:
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click **Daily News Fetch** workflow
3. Click **Run workflow** button
4. Select branch: `main`
5. Click green **Run workflow** button

## üìä Monitoring

### Check if it's running:
