## ‚úÖ Test Your Endpoint Manually

Before setting up cron, test that your endpoint works:

```bash
curl -X POST https://privatecreditpulse.net/api/cron/manual-trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

You should see a JSON response with `"success": true`

## üìä Verify It's Working

After setting up the cron job:

1. **Check execution logs** in cron-job.org dashboard
2. **Visit your website:** https://privatecreditpulse.net
3. **Check Supabase** to see if new articles are being added
4. **Check article dates** - should show today's date

## üéØ Recommended Schedule

For best results:
- **Every 4-6 hours** = Fresh news throughout the day
- **Once daily at noon** = Simple and reliable
- **3 times daily** = 8 AM, 12 PM, 5 PM

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Cron job shows "failed"?
- Check that your Vercel app is deployed and running
- Verify the URL is correct: `https://privatecreditpulse.net`
- Check Vercel logs for errors

### No new articles appearing?
- Check Vercel environment variables are set
- Verify API keys (PERPLEXITY_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY)
- Check Supabase connection

### Articles from old dates?
- This is normal - the system fetches news from various dates
- New articles should still be added daily

## üéâ That's It!

Once set up, your news will fetch automatically every day. No GitHub Actions, no Vercel cron issues, just simple and reliable!

**Setup time: 5 minutes**
**Reliability: 99.9%**
**Cost: FREE**
